- Exploit fact that k-space trajectories are the same for each coil
- Modify acquisition::Scatter to avoid sending/receiving redundant columns
- Allow for user-specified and/or dynamic step sizes
- Implement sequential version of Acquisition operator to test for correctness
- Look into fftw_malloc to see how to force Elemental's (Dist)Matrix to choose
  leading dimensions which make each column's pointer compatible
