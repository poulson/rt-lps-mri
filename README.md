**Real-Time Low-rank Plus Sparse MRI (RT-LPS-MRI)** is a distributed-memory 
parallelization of low-rank plus sparse decompositions of each 2D plane of 
dynamically accelerated MRI which builds on top of [Elemental](http://libelemental.org) and [NFFT3](http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/). 
This library is quite new, and so there is not yet any documentation.
In the mean time, the best references are 
[Elemental](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2427023.2427030) and 
[the paper which introduced the sequential algorithm](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/L+S-MRI.pdf).
